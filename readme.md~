## Description
**Pebble2048** is an adaptation of [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) on the Pebble Smartwatch, mainly showcasing various features of the Pebble, with interfacing between the Pebble app and the Android smartphone. This project was written as part of the [hackWATERLOO](http://hack-waterloo.com/) hackathon in March 2014. This app is available on the Pebble app store.

Based on [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) by Gabriele Cirulli, but with game code written entirely from scratch.

## How to Install
### The Easy Way
The Pebble2048 game is available on the Pebble app store.

### The Hard Way
1. Making sure you have already installed the [Pebble 2.0 SDK](https://developer.getpebble.com/2/getting-started/) on a Unix OS, download the `pebble_app` folder from this repository. 
2. Connect the smartphone with which your Pebble Smartwatch is paired to the same Wi-Fi network as your machine.
3. On a terminal, navigate to `pebble_app` on your machine. Then run the commands
   pebble build
   pebble install --phone $PHONE_IP
Where `$PHONE_IP` is the IP of your smartphone on the network.
